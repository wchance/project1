# 2. Development

Our portfolios change over time and most platforms shows your historical data, and your current performance, but not many of them can track the diferent stages in portfolios and keep them to compare to the chosen Portfolio. This project will require to develop a tool to keep track the diferent stages of the user's portfolio as screentshots on a gallery that can sroll to see what would have been the performance To-Date of a given portfolio. Also it will keep trak of every stock/portfolio included in the user's Watch lists and show the performance To-Date.

![PORTFOLIOS TIME MACHINE](/Portfolios_Time_Machine)

For the scope of this work the service will be available for users conected with any of  three mayor brokers: Interactive Brokers("i Use this one and i'm familiar with it",) Robinhood, and XXXXXXXXX. By the use of APIS, a pull request of the data will gather the required information. An alternate metehod would be the use of platforms like [PLAID](https://plaid.com/products/auth/overview/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=Search_G_Brand_Exact&utm_content=plaid&utm_term=plaid&utm_creative=481138286147&gclid=CjwKCAjwvMqDBhB8EiwA2iSmPEw55UTNOCqFC1q8oKE0GIMjkTe89u_oL4OGWFk-k7cvzULYNdFxoBoCKOsQAvD_BwE), that require the use of a single API, to connetc to a larger list of Brokers.

The algorithm will return the performance of any portfolio, based on the data, will chose the top 5 tocks performers based on; price increase, volatiilty, Risk-Reward, correlation etc, as well as the run  of future performance simulations to create the ideal portfolio based on the users picks, this can help the user make detitions to fine tune a portfolio or call for actionable insights.


# Enhacement(Optional Challenge)

Depending on the result of the Develpment stage, we can turn the code into a web app. By the use of a templated tool like [Bubble](https://bubble.io/welcome), wich uses no code drag-and-drop block of actions to develop apps.
